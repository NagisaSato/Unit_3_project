# Unit 3: Ski documentation application
![](ski.png)

# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition
My client for this project is my classmate, Elia Kobayashi, and he is a skier. During the winter, he is extremely active in skiing and he skiis very frequently. 
He aims to improve his skills and performance, however, it is difficult to determine improvements and practice times due to the lack of resources for his documentation of practices. From this inconvenience raised, my client would like an organised platform where his ski session details could be recorded and viewd easily. 


## Proposed Solution
### Design statement
To address the issue above, I would like to create an app that documents his ski progression and records. This app will be created using Python 3.0 and Kivy Library in corporation with GUI. The program will be coded on PyCharm. The app consists of a secure login and sign up system, where users could document nessasary information for documentation. This project will take 4 weeks and will be evaluated according to the criterias.  ** More details under 'Details' below. **

### Justification 
This game is created using python because it is the only language I am familiar with, and it is one of the most commonly used programming languages in the world. The game will be based on Mac OS, with an application called Pycharm. Pycharm was chosen to be used for this project because I am familiar with the application, and is one of the most used coding applications in the world. Pycharm is beginner-friendly in which the errors are clearly identified and highlighted. In addition, Pycharm processes are quick and efficient and therefore increases productivity and speed of my work. 

GUI is ulitilized for this project as I would like to make the app easy for the users to identify and use, thus making it more visual and useful for the users. Kivy Library will be utilized for the reason that is links with Python, and it could be presented in an organized manner, which will be extremely useful when we program detailed and long codes like in this project. The classes and inheritances can be easily displayed, and it also provides detailed customozation, making the final product personal and adjustabe for the user purpose. 

### Details
 The app will have a secure login system, where the user will first need to create an account. Their personal information; email, username, phonenumber, password and age. Once user infromation is created and stored, the user can then sign into the app using their username and password that they have set. In this app the user can input new/additional records, and view previous records as lists. The inputs that the user is able to put in are; training duration, date, max speed, location, total distance, and weather. There are separte screens for each operation, so the users are able to transfer into different screens accordingly. 
 
## Success Criteria
1. Include calendar for chosing date
2. Functioning sign up/sign in system with secure password storage (encrypted)
3. Ability for the user to input information for documentation of ski practice
4. Ability for the user to be able to view all the saved records on a screen
5. ski/winter themed login page
6. Ability to edit inputted data

The system will be based on Mac OS 10.15.6 with Dual-Core Intel Core i3. This game will be created on python 3.9, where input will be from keyboard and output generated as text and visuals on screen monitor.
